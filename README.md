# rm_tool_for_raw_data

A quick tool for processing data without proper polarization calibration.

It will fit for both rotation measure and cable delay between two receivers 
(for linear or circular receivers, use fit_RM_linear or fit_RM_circular respectively).

A test case is included, run python test.py to see whether it is properly running.
Refer to test.py file for an example of usage.
